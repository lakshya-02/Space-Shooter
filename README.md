# Space-Shooter
This Unity space shooter game, created by a beginner Lakshya, is a 2D action game set in outer space. Players control a spaceship, navigating through a starry background while shooting at incoming enemies. The main objective is to destroy as many enemy ships as possible to rack up points. Each enemy destroyed adds to the player's score, displayed on-screen to track progress.

The game features basic but satisfying mechanics: a firing sound effect when the player shoots, a responsive movement system, and simple particle effects that add flair to each shot. The controls are intuitive, allowing players to maneuver the spaceship smoothly using directional inputs and shoot projectiles at will. 

Players can pause the game at any time, which brings up a pause menu with options to resume, restart, or quit. This simple yet engaging project demonstrates core Unity skills, such as using triggers, handling UI elements for score and menus, and adding particle and sound effects for immersive gameplay.
